changed column names.

\details{
One of two options is allowd:
1: \code{field_names}, \code{new_cols}, and \code{colname_file_path} are \code{NULL}, in which case
the RAP-based column naming will be replae with the "old" local naming.
2: \code{field_names}, \code{new_cols}, and \code{colname_file_path} are provided by the user,
in which case the latter must contain as columns \code{field_names} and \code{new_cols}
that refer to the old to-be-replaced field names and the new names, respectively.
