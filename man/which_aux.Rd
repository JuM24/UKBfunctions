\arguments{
\item{df}{The input data frame.}

\item{missing_var}{The column name referring to the missing variable.}

\item{model_vars}{A list of column names for variables that are to be included
in the eventual analysis.}

\item{missing_n_flag}{The maximum proportion of missing values before the
variable is flagged.}

\item{inter_cor_flag}{The maximum absolute correlation with another variable
\itemize{
\item excluding the missing variable - before the variable is flagged.
}}

\item{missing_cor_flag}{The minimum correlation with the missing variable
among pairwise-complete cases before the variable is flagged.}
}
\description{
\code{which_aux} takes a data frame and returns a table with metrics relevant for
choosing auxiliary variables for multiple imputation of a missing variable.
These include for each variable the signed and absolute correlation
coefficients for the correlation with the missing variable; whether this
correlation exceeds the minimum threshold as defined by the user; the number of
missing observations; whether the missingness proportion exceeds a user-defined
threshold; whether any correlation with other variables exceeds a user-defined
threshold and - if so - how many.
